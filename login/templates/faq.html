                            We at Shipnext, care for your furry friends. Once we pick up your pet along with their cage we will make
                            sure they stay hydrated and comfortable through the journey. We will make sure that we connect you
                            only to those transporters who are comfortable in handling pets, so that there are no problems. However,
                            we recommend not to transport your pet if they are younger than 10 weeks or have any health issues. Also,
                            please consult with your vet for any precautions prior to travel. It will be a good idea to get your pet 
                            micro-chipped and have an ID around their collar along with you name, address and phone number.

                        <dd class="dd">
                            It is best to describe your delivery in the most accurate possible. For example,
                            while moving house hold god and furniture, the best thing to do would be to
                            measure height, width and length as an estimated cumulative. It is better for
                            the weight, however to be close to accurate, since prices vary according to weight.
